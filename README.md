# RemoveBG-GIMP
A small plugin to easily remove the background of an image using https://www.remove.bg/

THIS BRANCH WORKS ONLY FOR GIMP >= 3.0.
## Installation:
Put the remove_background folder(unzipped) in your plugin-directory

The directory can be e.g. at `C:\Program Files\GIMP 3\lib\gimp\3.0\plug-ins\` or `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins\`

The python file must be placed within a folder called `remove_background`. If the name of the folder does not match the name of the .py file, it won't work.

## Usage
1. Install the plugin as shown below
2. Filters → RemoveBackground → Remove Background
3. Enter your key in the key dialog. You get a API key for free at https://www.remove.bg/api
